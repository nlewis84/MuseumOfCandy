# MuseumOfCandy

This is the Museum of Candy project from Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course. Instead of doing this as a code along, I decided to do this project on my own and compare my work after the fact. I struggled with getting the Navbar transparency and scroll animation working properly. I did eventually get it to work somewhat, but this final version does use the JS code the Colt used....his just worked nicer than mine. The other main struggle of this project was getting the responsiveness at different sizes. By parsing the Bootstrap docs, I was able to get that all figured out.

I spent several hours, in total, working on this project.
